    <string name="text_guide">Guide:\n\nOn creating your Pure Data patch you can use any of the receivers from available sensors to interact with your patch.\n\nExample:\nIf you have Accelerometer available, your device will send float values using\n [s sensor1v0],\n [s sensor1v1],\n [s sensor1v2].\nThen you can create receivers for these sensors and use the values on your patch.\n\nTouch screen sensors are also available from [s sensorT0vx] to [s sensorT14vx], and [sensorT14vy] to [s sensorT14vy].\n\nCheck available sensors below and thanks for using Sensors2PD.\n\n</string>
